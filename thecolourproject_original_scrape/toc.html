    <br/>
    <p>These Terms may be modified from time to time. Modifications shall be effective immediately upon being posted to the Site. You should read these Terms whenever you visit the Site so that you are aware of any modifications. Your use of the Site after modifications have been posted constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms as modified.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>1. Restrictions on Use of the Site</h4>
    <br>
    <p>You may access and view the content on the Site on your computer or other device and, unless otherwise indicated in these Terms, make single copies or prints of the content from the Site solely for your personal, non-public, internal and non-commercial use.

For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise specifically indicated in these Terms or on the Site, use of the Site is only for your personal, internal and non-commercial use. You further agree that you may not alter, edit, delete, remove, otherwise change the meaning or appearance of, or repurpose, any of the content, code, data, or other materials on or available through the Site, including, without limitation, the alteration or removal of any trademarks, trade names, logos, service marks, or any other proprietary content or proprietary rights notices.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>2. Ownership</h4>
    <br>
    <p>TCP owns, solely and exclusively, all rights, title and interest in and to the Site. All of the content on the Site, including without limitation all text, images, graphics, sounds and software code, is the copyrighted work of TCP or others and your use of all such content is subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraph 1 above. The TCP trademarks and logos are owned by TCP and may not be used or displayed without the prior written consent of TCP. All trademarks, service marks and company names and logos appearing on the Site are the property of their respective owners and may not be used in connection with products and/or services that are not related to, associated with or sponsored by their rights holders, or in a manner likely to cause customer confusion, or in any manner that disparages or discredits their rights holders. Your misuse of the trademarks displayed on the Site is strictly prohibited. No right, title or interest in any Site content, code, data or materials, or in any trademarks, service marks or company names and logos appearing on the Site is transferred to you as a result of your use of the Site. If you make use of the Site, or the content, code, data or materials thereon or available through the Site, except as otherwise provided herein, you may violate copyright and other laws of Canada, other countries, as well as applicable state laws and may be subject to liability for such unauthorized use.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>3. Site Directed at Canadian Visitorsp</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The Site is targeted at and intended for visitors residing in Canada. Given the global nature of the Internet, however, the Site may be accessed by visitors residing outside of Canada. TCP makes no representations or warranties that the Site is appropriate or available for use in countries outside of Canada. Visitors who choose to access the Site from outside of Canada do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any and all local laws and regulations that may apply to such access.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>4. Public Forums & Code of Conduct</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>The Site may, from time to time, make messaging services, chat services, bulletin boards, message boards, blogs, other forums and other such services available on or through the Site. You agree that you shall not upload, post, transmit, distribute or otherwise publish through the Site or any service or feature made available on or through the Site, any materials which (i) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Site; (ii) are fraudulent, unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, offensive, pornographic, profane, sexually explicit or indecent; (iii) constitute or encourage conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any local, state, national or international law; (iv) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (v) violate, plagiarize or infringe the rights of third parties including, without limitation, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, contract, patent, rights of privacy or publicity or any other proprietary right; (vi) contain a virus, spyware, or other harmful component; (vii) contain embedded links, advertising, chain letters or pyramid schemes of any kind; or (viii) constitute or contain false or misleading indications of origin, endorsement or statements of fact. You further agree not to impersonate any other person or entity, whether actual or fictitious, including TCP, TCP’s family or TCP’s personnel. You may not offer to buy or sell any product or service on or through your comments submitted on the Site. You alone are responsible for the content and consequences of any of your activities and any actions that violate these Terms may subject you to civil and criminal liability. The posts, comments and/or messages of users of the Site do not reflect the views of TCP or the Site.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>5. Right to Monitor and Editorial Control</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>TCP reserves the right, but does not have an obligation, to monitor or review all materials posted to the Site, and TCP is not responsible for any such materials posted by users. However, TCP reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or TCP request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever.</p>
    <h4>6. Private or Sensitive Information on Public Forums</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>It is important to remember that comments submitted may be recorded and stored in multiple places, both on the Site and elsewhere on the Internet. It is therefore important that you are careful and selective about the personal information that you disclose about yourself and others, and in particular, you should not disclose sensitive, embarrassing, proprietary or confidential information to TCP or on the Site.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>7. Linking to the Site </h4>
    <br>
    <p>Unless otherwise specifically indicated in these Terms or on the Site, you agree that: (i) if you include a link from any other web site to the Site, such link shall open in a new browser window and shall link to the full version of an HTML formatted page of this Site; (ii) you are not permitted to link directly to any image hosted on the Site, such as using an "in-line" linking method to cause the image hosted by the Site to be displayed on another web site; and (iii) you may not download or use images hosted on this Site on another web site, for any purpose, including, without limitation, posting such images on another site. You agree not to link from any other web site to this Site in any manner such that the Site, or any page of the Site, is "framed," surrounded or obfuscated by any third party content, materials or branding. TCP reserves all of TCP’s rights under the law to insist that any link to the Site be discontinued, and to revoke your right to link to the Site from any other web site at any time upon written notice to you.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>8. Links to Third Party Sites</h4>
    <br>
    <p>To provide you with access to related sites, the Site may contain links to third party websites.

TCP is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any of such third party websites. TCP is not affiliated with, and does not endorse or sponsor, any such third party websites or any product or service of any such third parties. The Site disclaims any liability for links from another web site to this Site or for links to another website from this Site. TCP does not represent or warrant that the contents of any third party web site are accurate, compliant with state or federal law, or compliant with copyright or other intellectual property laws. Any reliance on the contents of a third party web site is done at your own risk and you assume all responsibilities and consequences resulting from such reliance.</p>
    <h4>9. User Registration and Security</h4>
    <br>
    <p>You understand that you may need to provide certain information (e.g. phone number, email) to have access to some parts of the Site and/or to access the texting service, depending on whether you are a TCP volunteer, help-seeker, or both. In consideration of your use of the Site, you will: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business as prompted by the Site's registration forms (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or TCP has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, TCP has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof). You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and your account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security of which you become aware. You are responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Site.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>10. Disclaimer</h4>
    <br>
    <p>YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. </p>
    <br>
    <p>TCP IS NOT A CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICE and TCP VOLUNTEERS ARE NOT LICENSED COUNSELLORS, THERAPISTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS OR OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. You are responsible for evaluating any advice received and the appropriateness for your circumstances. To the extent that some TCP Volunteers may practice professionally outside of TCP as licensed counsellors, therapists, psychologists, or other health professionals, for the purposes of TCP, these volunteers are NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE AS LICENSED PROFESSIONALS, are given and tasked with the same training, approaches, duties, resources, and expectations as other volunteers without professional qualifications, and are covered under all terms and agreements within this document and within the TCP Privacy Policy as set forth on the Site. TCP cannot predict or assess the competence of, or appropriateness for your needs, of the TCP volunteer as a licensed professional outside of his/her capacity as a TCP volunteer. You are responsible for seeking out a professional outside of TCP to obtain professional advice as necessary.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Crisis situations are defined as any noted risk or act of harm to self, harm to others, or other acts or events that may or be expected to lead to an unstable and dangerous situation for help-seekers, volunteers, or other individuals, groups, communities, or the whole society.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your relationship relating to the TCP volunteer is strictly with the TCP volunteer. We are not involved in any way with the actual substance of that relationship, although we endeavour by all means to train and support volunteers to the fullest extent possible and to ensure that guidelines are followed to the fullest extent possible, along with auditing messages periodically. </p>
    <br>
    <p>All text messages sent and received by TCP volunteers and users of the texting platform are stored for one year, and accessible by TCP administration for audit purposes and to ensure safety of all users. </p>
    <br>
    <p>TCP makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to (a) the willingness or ability of any TCP volunteer to give advice, (b) whether users/help-seekers find a TCP volunteer’s assistance to be useful or satisfactory, (c) whether the user/help-seeker finds a TCP volunteer’s advice relevant, useful, accurate or satisfactory, (d) whether the TCP volunteer’s assistance will be helpful, (e) whether the advice of the TCP volunteer will be responsive or relevant to the user/help-seeker’s question, or (f) whether any advice from a TCP volunteer will otherwise be suitable to the user/help-seeker’s needs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>TCP attempts to the best extent to verify the skills, qualifications, or background of all TCP volunteers. While we endeavour to do so to the best of our abilities, in our sole discretion, you acknowledge that we do not represent to verify, and do not guarantee the verification of, the skills, qualifications, competence or background of any TCP volunteer. </p>
    <br>
    <p>TCP may provide bulletin boards which allow community members to post questions about various topics and allow users/help-seekers, TCP volunteers, and others to support each other and answer questions. Information and advice found on via TCP is intended for general information purposes only and does not replace a meeting with a professional. You are encouraged to verify any information provided on the Site. Any reliance on information is done at your sole risk and liability.</p>
    <br>
    <p>TCP DOES NOT WARRANT THE VALIDITY, ACCURACY, OR AVAILABILITY OF ANY CONTENT OR ADVICE PROVIDED BY TCP VOLUNTEERS AND TCP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY USERS/HELP-SEEKERS DUE TO RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.</p>
    <br>
    <p>IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE, IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU MAY BE A DANGER TO YOURSELF OR TO OTHERS OR IF YOU OTHERWISE HAVE ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY CALL 911 AND NOTIFY THE POLICE OR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.</p>
