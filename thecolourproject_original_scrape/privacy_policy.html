    <h4>The Colour Project</h4>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h5>We take your privacy seriously.</h5>
    <br/>
    <p>Welcome to The Colour Project community, and thank you for helping us build a more colourful world,
      together. The Colour Project Society (“TCP” or “we”) is committed to respecting your privacy. This
      Privacy Policy will advise you about the information TCP may collect about you, the choices you have
      regarding the use of your information, and how your personal information is protected when you use this
      website (the “Site”). Please read this policy carefully.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to sites maintained
      by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for
      the actions and privacy policies of third party websites.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      By visiting the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice and by posting such revised terms to the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively or to personally identifiable information already in our possession, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments and seek your consent for such use.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h4>1. The Information TCP Collects</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>
      When you visit the Site, you may be invited to provide personal information in order to receive additional information from TCP or the Site, such as your email address and/or phone number. The Site may also collect other information when you visit the Site that does not personally identify you, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, and your device identifiers (non-personally identifiable information or “non-PII”). Such information is sometimes collected to improve the design and content of the Site or analyze site usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Site expands, you may be invited to provide additional information through the Site. TCP may use your contact data to send you information about TCP, the Site or any topic connected therewith. If you choose to submit content (e.g., post a comment on the Site), we may publish your name, username, and/or any other information you have submitted. You hereby consent to this and agree to comply with and be bound by the Terms of Use, published on the site and incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <b><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u></b>
    <br>
    <p>TCP considers “Personal Data” to include information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify or contact you, such as: email address, username, name, address, or phone number. TCP does not consider Personal Data to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual. Any user can request a download of their own Personal Data that TCP currently stores, and also request deletion of their account and associated Personal Data. The exception to this rule is if the user in question has broken the terms laid out in the Terms of Service and caused harm or abused our Services or other members. In this case, we retain the right to keep some of your information in order to provide more security and safety to our members. </p>
    <br>
    <p>As a general matter, you can browse the Site without submitting your personally identifiable information to us. However, the following are circumstances where you may supply us with your personally identifiable information. The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your personally identifiable information at this time:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign up with phone number to begin using the core TCP service (TCP will not share this information with anyone outside of the administration team, including with volunteers, help-seekers, third-parties, and others)</li>
      <li>Sign up to receive email newsletters or e-mail alerts from us</li>
      <li>Sign up to receive email offers from TCP or TCP partners</li>
      <li>Request for assistance</li>
      <li>Participation on social media accounts involving TCP and/or our Site</li>
      <li>Submission of user generated content on any part of the Site that permits it</li>
      <li>Any other place on the Site where you knowingly volunteer personally identifiable information</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <b><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u></b>
    <br>
    <p>In addition, when you interact with the Site, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our Site (“non-personally identifiable information” or “non-PII”). Generally, we collect and store the following categories of non-personally identifiable information:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Demographic data such as age and gender. This may also include the number of guests on the Site. The Site may post such information in the aggregate on the Site or provide such information to third parties.</li>
      <li>Device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Site. This information may include IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information. </li>
      <li>Usage information about your use of the Site. This information includes a reading history of the pages you view. We use this information to provide you a more customized experience on the Site.</li>
      <li>Additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.</li>
      <li>Your search terms and search results on the Site, as well as other information regarding your use of the Site.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: TCP Volunteer Applicants</p>
    <br>
    <p>All interested applicants for the position of TCP Volunteer will be required to submit Personal Data as requested. Any information supplied by or on behalf of an applicant for purposes of becoming a TCP Volunteer will be maintained by TCP. Please note that TCP may have additional privacy terms that apply to TCP Volunteers. Such terms will be made available when an applicant applies to be a TCP Volunteer or otherwise accesses his or her account.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>2. How TCP Uses Your Information</h4>
    <br>
    <p>We may use any information we learn from you to help us personalize and continually improve your experience on the Site. We may use your personally and non-personally identifiable information in the following ways:</p>
    <b><u>A. General Uses</u></b>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide you with the content, products and services you request</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about your account or transactions with us and send you information about features and enhancements on or to our Site</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about changes to our policies</li>
      <li>Optimize or improve our products, services and operations</li>
      <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b><u>B. Combination of Your Personally Identifiable Information</u></b>
    <p>We may use the information from one portion of the Site on other portions of Site, and we may combine information gathered from multiple portions of the Site into a single user record. </p>
    <br/>
    <h4>3. Information Shared With Third Parties</h4>
    <br>
    <p>TCP may employ outside agents, meaning other companies or individuals, to perform functions on its behalf, such as sending e-mail and analyzing data. Such agents have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. TCP may also release personal information when it believes, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply the provisions of its Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property or safety of TCP or the Site, its users, or others. We will also disclose personally identifiable information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request.</p>
    <br>
    <p>TCP retains the right to transfer your personal information to a successor in interest pursuant to a change of control of the Site or a sale of all or substantially all of the Site’s assets.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We may disclose or share non-personally identifiable information (or other information, other than personally identifiable information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary, as described below.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>4. Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Third Party Tracking Information</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Like many websites, we use “cookies,” which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. The cookies the Site uses do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer as well as the first name of the person logging in. The Site may use cookies to remember information users give to the Site so they don’t have to re-enter it each time they visit the Site. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Site and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. You are always free to decline the cookies if your browser permits. Even without a cookie, you will still be able to use most of the features on the Site.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Site may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We may also use web beacons. A web beacon is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of a given website. We do not share or provide personally identifiable information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, email addresses and phone numbers without your express permission.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Site may be served by unaffiliated third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">http://www.aboutads.info</a> or the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because a “Do Not Track” compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, TCP’s information collection and disclosure practices, and the options that we provide to users, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>5. Aggregate Information</h4>
    <br>
    <p>We may aggregate information so that it is not Personal Data, and we may use and share such aggregated information for training and quality assurance purposes, for purposes of delivering our services, for purposes of expanding and improving our services and for other lawful purposes. This data is anonymized and stored securely.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From time to time, we may use user information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the policy change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>6. Legal Grounds for Handling Personal Data</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Some laws require organizations to inform users about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your Personal Data. To the extent those laws apply to TCP, our legal grounds include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We handle your Personal Data to create an account (user or volunteer) and to provide our services to you</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about your account or transactions with us and send you information about features and enhancements on or to our Site</li>
      <li>We need to use and sometimes disclose Personal Data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>In many cases, we handle your personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience</li>
      <li>Service to users</li>
      <li>Communications (including sending emails or other communications to let you know about new features we offer)</li>
      <li>Protecting our users, community, personnel and property</li>
      <li>Analyzing and improving our offerings (such as collecting information about how you use our Services to optimize the design and usability of certain features)</li>
      <li>Anonymizing and aggregating user data for research to improve our Services</li>
      <li>Managing legal issues</li>
      <li>As part of the consent process any Personal Data collected is only disclosed and shared with emergency personnel if TCP becomes aware of and believes that you or others are in imminent risk of harm</li>
      <li>Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle Personal Data on the basis of your implied or express consent</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>7. Protecting Your Information</h4>
    <br>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of your personally identifiable information and take reasonable security measures to protect such information. Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your personally identifiable information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is advisable for you to protect the privacy of your own information. You must take precautions to protect the security of any personally identifiable information that you may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless (WiFi) networks or similar devices. You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks. It is also important to remember that comments submitted may be recorded and stored in multiple places, both on the Site and elsewhere on the Internet. It is therefore important that you are careful and selective about the personal information that you disclose about yourself and others, and in particular, you should not disclose sensitive, embarrassing, proprietary or confidential information to TCP or on the Site.</p>
    <br>
    <b><u>Data Retention</u></b>
    <p>All text messages sent and received by TCP volunteers and users of the texting platform are stored for one year. TCP will store your user account and associated Personal Data as long as your account is active.</p>
    <h4>8. Opt-Out Provisions</h4>
    <br>
    <p>You may always opt-out of receiving future email messages and newsletters from TCP. You may opt-out of receiving communications from us by contacting <a href="mailto:hello@thecolourproject.ca">hello@thecolourproject.ca</a>.</p>
    <h4>9. Children</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age and TCP does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not provide personal information to TCP without providing us with consent from your parents. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information and we do not have parental consent, TCP will immediately delete that child’s information from the Site. If you believe that TCP has been provided with the personal information of a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:hello@thecolourproject.ca">hello@thecolourproject.ca</a>.</p>
    <h4>10. Contacting the Site</h4>
    <br>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, the practices of the Site, the content available on the Site or your interactions with the Site, you can contact <a href="mailto:hello@thecolourproject.ca">hello@thecolourproject.ca</a>.</p>
